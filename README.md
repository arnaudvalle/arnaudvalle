# Bonjour
         
I’m Arnaud, a senior full-stack engineer based in Lyon, France.
         
At [365Talents](https://www.365talents.com/), I lead development teams and optimize technical processes to create scalable, high-quality web solutions for our AI-powered HR solution for skills and talent management.

When I’m not coding, refactoring, linting, testing, documenting or squashing bugs, you’ll find me exploring far-off destinations, gaming on my PS5 or unwinding at a local pub.
