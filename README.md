# Bonjour
         
I’m Arnaud, a front-end developer living in Lyon, France.
         
I spend most of my working days doing JavaScript at [365Talents](https://www.365talents.com/), trying to improve talent management in companies.

When I don’t write, refactor, lint, test, document or bug fix stuff on *the internets*, I love travelling out to faraway places, nerding out on my PS4 or dropping by the nearest pub to share a pint (or three).
